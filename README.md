## About The Project

AffecTune is a mobile app that detects emotions through images and recommends songs tailored to these moods.
Users can capture a photo, review it, receive an emotion analysis, and then get personalized song recommendations which they can rate and shuffle for new options.

### Introduction 
  Welcome to AffecTune: Users are greeted by an intuitive intro screen, setting the stage for an engaging user experience.
### Photo Capture 
  Initiate the Journey: Begin by capturing a moment in a photo, setting the stage for the app's emotion detection capabilities.
### Photo Review Screen
  Review and Decide: After capturing the image, you have the power to review and either accept or retake it, ensuring the analysis reflects your true emotion.
### Emotional Insight
Discover Your Emotion: The app analyzes your photo and reveals the detected emotion, seamlessly connecting your current emotional state to the next phase of your musical journey.
### Personalized Music Therapy
Tailored Song Recommendations: Following the emotion analysis, AffecTune offers song suggestions that resonate with your mood, harmoniously combining emotional awareness with musical variety.
### Endless Discoveries
Continual Exploration: The experience extends beyond a single song. You're encouraged to re-engage, delving deeper into your emotional landscape through music, with each session revealing new facets of your mood.

## Acknowledgments

For the backend of this project, I have partnered with my university colleague, [Andrei Moldovan](https://github.com/Lordsib), who has experience in Machine Learning. 
Together, we developed API endpoints for emotion detection using images, along with a dynamic, self-optimizing song recommendation system. 
This system continually enhances song suggestions based on user feedback, ensuring increasingly accurate and personalized recommendations.
